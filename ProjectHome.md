# Multi-Scale Connectome Browser #

The goal of the Multi-Scale Connectome Browser or MCB(mcb) is to construct a software system that generates interactive diagrams of brain networks at multiple levels of analysis.
This is the project site for its development.  MCB is still in its infancy.  You can see [a short clip](http://screenr.com/ivh) of its alpha form online.
