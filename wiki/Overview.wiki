#summary Overview

= Multi-Scale Connectome Browser. =

This document will describe the development of the Multi-Scale Connectome Browser or MCB(mcb).  MCB is still in its infancy but the goal of the project is to construct a software system that generates interactive diagrams of brain networks at multiple levels of analysis.  You can see [http://screenr.com/ivh a short clip] of its alpha form online. 

== Running Java Network Launching Protocol ==

You can [http://ccdb-dev-db2.crbs.ucsd.edu/multi-scale-connectome-browser-0.1.7-stable/BuildConnections.jnlp run the latest version] from your browser.  This server contains the JNLP for the mcb application. 

You will be prompted to open the JNLP file with Java's Web Start Launcher.  If this is not the case choose Java's Web Start Launcher by selecting "Open with" and choosing the application from the scroll bar.  Once the above step is completed click "OK" and "Run".
